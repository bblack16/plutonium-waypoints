# Plutonium Waypoints and Scripts

This repository is a collection of various things I've created or modified for Plutonium for my own personal set up. Waypoints for Bot Warfare can be found in iw5/waypoints. I'm also working on porting some game mods and adding my own personal changes via scripts which can be found in `iw5/scripts`. Instructions on usage will be found in a [separate README](iw5/scripts/README.md) in that directory.

# Requirements
1. [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/)
2. [Bot Warfare Mod](https://github.com/ineedbots/iw5_bot_warfare) (for bot waypoints)

# Waypoints Usage

1. Download this repo entirely or the specific waypoint file you want.
2. Extract your bot warfare file (`z_svr_bots.iwd`) using 7zip, ark, etc.. (it is just a zip file).
3. Add the waypoints you want to the `scripts/mp/` path that you just extracted from `iw5/waypoints`.
4. Re-zip the files you unzipped from bot warfare and rename the file to `z_svr_bots.iwd`.
5. Overwrite your original bot warfare file and relaunch plutonium and enjoy some bots!

I have started versioning my waypoints within each gcs file so it is easier to tell if I've made changes since they were last downloaded. I will be sure to bump these versions anytime I make updates going forward.

# Scripts Usage

Head to the dedicated readme found [here](iw5/scripts/README.md).
