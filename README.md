# plutonium-waypoints
Waypoint files for bots in plutonium. I've been trying to add bots to all of the custom maps that I can find that are not already covered by others in the Plutonium forums. Currently I only have files for IW5 (MW3).

# Requirements
1. [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/)
2. [Bot Warfare Mod](https://github.com/ineedbots/iw5_bot_warfare)

# Usage

1. Download this repo entirely or the specific waypoint file you want.
2. Extract your bot warfare file (`z_svr_bots.iwd`) using 7zip, ark, etc.. (it is just a zip file).
3. Add the waypoints you want to the `scripts/mp/` path that you just extracted.
4. Re-zip the files you unzipped from bot warfare and rename the file to `z_svr_bots.iwd`.
5. Overwrite your original bot warfare file and relaucnh plutonium and enjoy some bots!
